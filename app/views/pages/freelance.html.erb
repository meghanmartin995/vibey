  <h2>the challenge ‚úçÔ∏è</h2>
  <p>For this client, their current online store was not functioning at the payment stage and she needed a redesign of her website. Her website had beenc created over a decade ago and she couldn't edit any products and customers couldn't finish the buying process. I researched the variety of solutions and we decided on the optimal solution technology wise taking into account the budget, timeframe, advantages and disadvantages. </p>

  <h2>design process üë©‚Äçüíª</h2>
  <p>My process for freelance clients begins with a discovery meeting to deeply understand their business needs and current situation. Once we choose a direction, I scope the project and sent for her approval. To start the design I work back and forth with the client to audit their brand and create a moodboard of the feel of the website. Next, we go through websites on the market to understand their design preferences and build a common design language. Next I create a style guide for the website with colors, fonts and snippets of the future UI. Once this is approved, I create three mockup options and let the client choose the direction. From here, I move into final prototypes and ultimately the development phase. In this case, I created a custom Shopify store, but development varies case by case.</p>

<section class="problem">
  <h2>what i've <br>learned üìö</h2>
  <p>The biggest lesson I've learned through freelance work is that deeply understanding and listening to business challenges is the priority over the design itself. Often a client needs a business partner in strategy, not just a designer. This client on their previous website couldn't use other payments methods outside of Paypal so understanding this pain and offering solutions to take many payment providers was a huge first win. </p>
