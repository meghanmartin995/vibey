  <h2>the problem ‚úçÔ∏è</h2>
  <p>the core problem we are trying to solve is <span>reducing the time it takes for COVID-19 researchers to digest research papers </span>with human and machine intelligence, we are condensing large research papers into main key findings, methods, context and molecular targets. the design challenge is how to present this information in a way that‚Äôs quickly digestable.</p>

Time to digest this information and to conduct R&D would be reduced dramatically if this information was summarized at the beginning of the paper.</p>

    <p>Researchers expressed the need for a clean UI that condenses dense amounts of information into a quickly scannable interface. I chose to include a toggle for less and more information to allow for scrolling of the page without the need to click through to understand the research more deeply. Aesthetics were largely sacrificed for usability and readability.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="finding2 finding" style="align-self: center">
    <%= image_tag("marker-2.svg") %>
    <p>We needed to create an admin interface to accept and reject research summaries. I designed this interface with the intention of reusing components from the public interface to save development time. I included large indicators of red and green to quickly show to the admin the state of each research paper. </p>

    <p>I took design references from Google, Wikipedia and ResearchGate to develop an interface that would be familiar and trusted by researchers. The colors, font, font size ratios, spacing and overall feel of the UI was influenced from these sources that researchers already use on a day to day basis.</p>

  <h2>what i've <br>learned üìö</h2>
  <p>I really enjoyed working with the team of developers on this project and I learned a lot from their different expertises to grow as a designer. Sebastian, a front end dev on the team, taught me a lot about accessibility and React. Mat, the backend developer, taught me a lot about thinking from a future perspective on dev decisions to scale the project. From also having a dev perspective, I was able to keep the design very lean and minimal and optimize for reusability.</p>
