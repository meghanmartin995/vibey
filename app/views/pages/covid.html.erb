  <h2>the problem ‚úçÔ∏è</h2>
  <p>the core problem we are trying to solve is <span>reducing the time it takes for COVID-19 researchers to digest research papers </span>with human and machine intelligence, we are condensing large research papers into main key findings, methods, context and molecular targets. the design challenge is how to present this information in a way that‚Äôs quickly digestable.</p>
